Exercises on controlling or making changes to bits
Can be bit:
	*  or(|)-any bit on operands added to result
	* &-only bits in both operands added to result
	* ^(xor)- only bits in one operand added to result
	* <<- left shift, similar to multiplying by 2 to the power of no of space shifts, only if no isnt negative or no of shifts not greater than no
	* >>-right shift
